# Your first form

In this page I'll give you a high level view of what you can do with [Arkform]() and link various pages for extra details.

### Theme

When you first install [Arkform]() there are no themes, this is because all themes are in your control. Find out how to install themes [here](/customization/theme)

OK, lets start with a minimal example. A form requires only a few things to work. The core, of course, is the `<ark-form />` tag. All form state is orginised using this tag. `<ark-input/>` and `<ark-group/>` elements must be inside a `<ark-form/>` to work at all.

```html
<ark-form>
    <ark-input name="message" />
</ark-form>
```

<ExampleIframe url="/plain-input" style="max-height: 200px;"/>

## Validation

[Full validation breakdown](/validation)

To validate a form we can pass in a validator to a `<ark-input />` element. We can pass a **string** or a **string[]**.

```html
<ark-form>
    <ark-input name="message" ark="string>=10" />
</ark-form>
```
<ExampleIframe url="/input-string>10" style="max-height: 200px;" />

For all primitives we can pass as strings. See the all the primitive validators [here](https://arktype.io)

```html
<ark-form>
    <ark-input name="message" :ark="['string>=10', 'string.alphanumeric']" />
</ark-form>
```
<ExampleIframe url="/input-stringarray" style="max-height: 200px;"/>

## Groups

[Full groups breakdown](/components/groups)

Groups are how you turn repeatable form structures into clean, validated, type-safe arrays. Whether you're collecting a string[] (like emails) or an object[] (like shipping addresses), `<ark-group>` makes it feel like plain HTML while giving you full validation and control.

### What is a group?

An `<ark-group>` is a container for one or more `<ark-input>` components. Every time the group is "submitted" (via `$arkform.addItem()`), it collects the current values of those inputs and pushes a new item into the group‚Äôs items array.

Doing this you're building a list of validated objects, typed and ready to use.

The `<ark-group />` element takes `<ark-inputs />` as its descendents and you use them like normal. An `<ark-group />` element exposes many of the same state objects as a form for complete control.

Each group exposes an array named `items`. This is where all form data is stored. You can access these items if needed using the `v-model:items`.

```html
<ark-form>
    <ark-group ref="group">
        <ark-input name="message2" />
        <ark-input name="message3" />
        <ark-email />
    </ark-group>

    <button @click="group?.addItem()">Submit</button>
</ark-form>

<script lang="ts">
const group = ref(null)
</script>
```

<ExampleIframe url="/group" style="max-height: 300px; min-height: 450px;"/>

To make building dynamic forms even faster, Arkform will include plug-and-play UI components for common use cases. These will give you everything you need to add, edit, and delete items from your group arrays ‚Äî no boilerplate required.

**Some planned components:**

üü¶ Pill-style inputs ‚Äì perfect for collecting lists like email[] or tags[]

üóÇÔ∏è Editable tables ‚Äì ideal for managing object[] like user info, addresses, or product variants.

These components are designed to just drop in and work out of the box ‚Äî while still providing the underlying API for when you need to build something custom.

## First Form

This is the basis of all the form logic used by arkform. All forms must be inside of one of these tags.

```html
<ark-form />
```

This is the simplest form we can make. But more is going on than meets the eye

```html
<ark-form>
    <ark-input name="message" />
</ark-form>
```
This form will render a simple form input and a label. By default the label will be the same as the name.

Inputs can take certain custom components. For example, you can pass a label or a help component that will be rendered.

```html
<ark-form>
    <ark-input name="message">
        <ark-label>A custom label:</ark-label>
        <ark-help>Please input a message</ark-help>
    </ark-input>
</ark-form>
```

Ark inputs expose a their state to be used. 

```html
<ark-input v-model="state" />
```
